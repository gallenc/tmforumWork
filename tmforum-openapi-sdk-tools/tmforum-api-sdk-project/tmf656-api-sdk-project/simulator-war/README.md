# TMF TMF656 Service Problem Management API Simulator

## Overview

This code has been generated based on the spec in https://github.com/tmforum-apis/TMF656_ServiceProblemManagement

The swagger annotated model was generated by the by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. 
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  

This is an example of building a swagger-enabled JAX-RS server.

This example uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run-war
```

You can then view the swagger listing here:

```
