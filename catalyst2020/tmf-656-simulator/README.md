# TMF656 simulator

The simulator is built within the tmforum-openapi-sdk-tools project.

A pre-built executable jar is provided in the github releases system.

To run the war use
```
java -jar tmf656-livewar-assembly-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
```
and open a browser at http://localhost:8080/tmf656-simulator-war/

(note that currently the https option does not work when the executable war is used)
